RESTBlock
=========

This is an ultra-light wrapper for performing basic REST calls by extending NSURLConnection to 
execute the calls in code blocks.  The idea here is to offer some basic features and let you 
expand as you need.  Ideas for features?  POSTs and PUTs that act like FORM submittals, handling 
large file posts (allowing the UI to know about status), and dealing with REST-based error codes.

Enjoy!
